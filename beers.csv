Serving suggestion: Classic wheat beer blends gently spicy malt aromas with mildly bitter hops. Its secret lies in our unique Erdinger brewing yeasts. They provide the fruity notes and unmistakably fresh flavour. The finishing touch for every Erdinger Weissbier is a further specialty: the “Bayerische Edelreifung” or double maturity method. After the main fermentation process, we give our beer the time it needs to mature a second time in the bottle. And we are happy to give it this time. Because this allows its delicious lively nature and the harmonious interplay of its various aromas to fully unfold",5.3,3.4,0.6415094339622641,erdinger-weissbier-wheat-beer-bottle-500ml
